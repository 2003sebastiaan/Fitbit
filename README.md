Project Structure:

Part 1: 

Data Exploration and Visualization

Load and explore daily_activity.csv.

Compute the total distance covered by each user.

Visualize calories burned per user with a line graph (with date range filtering).

Create a bar plot showing workout frequency by day of the week.

Perform a linear regression to predict calories burned based on total steps.

Develop a function to visualize individual regression results.

Additional creative insights and data visualizations.

All outputs are generated via a single Python script.

Part 2: 

Setting Up a GitHub Repository

Initialize a GitHub repository for version control.

Ensure all group members contribute using Git commits.

Maintain an updated README.md to document project progress and usage.

Part 3: 

Database Interaction & Analysis

Classify participants into Light, Moderate, and Heavy users.

Use SQLite3 to interact with fitbit_database.db.

Investigate relationships between sleep duration and activity levels.

Perform regression analysis on sedentary activity and sleep duration.

Aggregate data into 4-hour time blocks and analyze trends in steps, calories, and sleep.

Create a function to display heart rate and exercise intensity for a selected user.

Investigate the impact of weather conditions on user activity using external weather data.

Part 4: 

Data Wrangling & Statistical Analysis

Handle missing values in the weight log table using alternative methods.

Merge tables and analyze statistics per individual.

Summarize data to prepare for dashboard integration.

Identify general statistical trends such as:

Correlation between daily activity and sleep duration.

Differences in behavior during weekends vs. weekdays.

Impact of weather conditions on activity levels.

Part 5: 

Dashboard Development

Use Streamlit to create an interactive dashboard.

Minimum requirements:

Opening page with general statistical insights (graphical and numerical summaries).

Sidebar for selecting a user ID to view personal statistics.

Time-filtering functionality for displaying data within a date/time range.

Sleep duration analysis and factors affecting sleep quality.
